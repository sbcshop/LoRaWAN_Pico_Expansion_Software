## Getting Started with LoRaWAN for Pico
### Pinout

### Interfacing Overview
<img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/interfacing_details.png" width="578" height="392"> 

### Step 1: Setup and installation
  * Connect Pico/Pico2 Microcontroller board on expansion along with suitable Antenna you received.

    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/lorawan_pico_expansion.png" width="" height=""> 

  * We need **MicroPython** firmware .UF2 preinstalled with the corresponding Pico, if not, follow steps mentioned in the link [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) to do that.
  * Second we need **Thonny IDE** software for the programming and testing purpose. You can download and install from [here](https://thonny.org/).
  * Once everything ready, connect pico to laptop/PC with micro USB and then proceed for next step.

### Step 2: Testing and Running Demo 
  * Download this complete github which contains lib and example codes,

    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/git_download.png" width="389" height="323">

  * Open any demo example in Thonny IDE, also make sure file view is checked for easy operation which is useful for easy access of file from System and Pico board. Select micropython board as shown below,

    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/board_select.png"  width="" height="">

  * Upload [lib](https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/tree/main/examples/lib) folder to Pico board and save [example](https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/tree/main/examples) to try as **main.py**.

    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/upload_files.png"  width="" height="">

  * You can even run example for debugging through Thonny by clicking Green Play button as shown.

    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/run_example.png"  width="957" height="508">

  * To try P2P or LoRaWAN related examples make sure jumper setting is on RAK-PICO side as shown below,

    <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/jumper_sel.jpg" width="233" height="162">

  * Once everything all set so now you can try [examples](https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/tree/main/examples) related to P2P/Lorawan commmunication 

## RAK3172 Module Standalone
* You can access RAK3172 module directly. For this remove Pico from header and change jumper selection to USB-RAK side as shown below,
  
  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Pico_Expansion_Software/blob/main/images/rak3172_direct_access.jpg" width="316" height="276">

* Connect device to PC/laptop using Type C. Now you can follow steps mentioned [here](https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Breakout_Software) to use RAK3172 module standalone like breakout for changing configuration or [Firmware update](https://github.com/sbcshop/LoRaWAN_Breakout_Software/blob/main/documents/Firmware%20Update%20Procedure%20with%20WisToolBox.pdf).
