### Step 1: Setup and installation
  * Connect Pico/Pico2 Microcontroller board on expansion along with suitable Antenna you received.

  * We need **MicroPython** firmware .UF2 preinstalled with the corresponding Pico, if not, follow steps mentioned in the link [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html) to do that.
  * Second we need **Thonny IDE** software for the programming and testing purpose. You can download and install from [here](https://thonny.org/).
  * Once everything ready, connect pico to laptop/PC with micro USB and then proceed for next step.

### Step 2: Testing and Running Demo 
  * Download this complete github which contains lib and example codes,

  * Open any demo example in Thonny IDE, also make sure file view is checked for easy operation which is useful for easy access of file from System and Pico board. Select micropython board as shown below,
